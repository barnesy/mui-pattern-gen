# Drag and Drop Test Results

## Fixed Issues:

1. **Grid Container Drop Zones**: 
   - Updated `DraggableComponent` to better detect when dropping into containers vs. near edges
   - Added edge threshold detection (30px) to differentiate between dropping inside a container vs. before/after it
   - Grid containers now properly accept drops in their center area

2. **Palette to Container Drops**:
   - Extended `DraggableComponent` to accept both existing components and new components from the palette
   - Added `onDropNew` prop to handle dropping new components at specific positions
   - Components can now be dragged directly from the palette into containers

3. **Demo Setup**:
   - Fixed the demo creation to properly set up parent-child relationships
   - Grid container now explicitly initializes with an empty children array
   - Cards are properly added to the grid's children after creation

## How Drop Zones Work:

1. **Edge Drop Zones** (Before/After):
   - Active within 30px of component edges
   - Shows blue line indicator above or below component
   - Used for reordering components

2. **Container Drop Zones** (Inside):
   - Active in the center area of container components (Grid, Stack, Container)
   - Shows dashed outline when hovering
   - Used for nesting components inside containers

3. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Blue line above: Drop before component
   - Blue line below: Drop after component
   - Dashed outline: Drop inside container
   - Opacity change: Component being dragged

## Testing Instructions:

1. Navigate to `/drag-drop-design` route
2. Click "Create Demo" to set up test components
3. Try these actions:
   - Drag "Page Header" from the demo and drop it into the Grid container (should see dashed outline)
   - Drag a new component from the palette directly into the Grid
   - Drag cards to reorder them within the Grid
   - Create nested layouts by dropping containers into other containers

The drag and drop should now work correctly with proper visual feedback and container detection!

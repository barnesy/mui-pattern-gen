# Sub-Component UI Fix Summary

## The Problem
When selecting LabelValuePair sub-components, the controls weren't showing in the AI Design Mode drawer.

## Root Cause
The `SettingsPanel` component filters out `text` and `number` controls (lines 34-36 in SettingsPanel.tsx) because it's designed for pattern settings only, not content editing.

LabelValuePair configuration includes many text controls:
- `label` (text)
- `value` (text)  
- `helpText` (text)
- `trendValue` (text)

These were being filtered out, leaving only select/boolean controls visible.

## The Fix
1. Import `PatternPropsPanel` in AIDesignModeDrawer
2. Use `PatternPropsPanel` for sub-components (shows all controls)
3. Continue using `SettingsPanel` for regular patterns (filters content controls)
4. Hide Copy/Reset buttons for sub-components (they're in PatternPropsPanel)

## Testing
1. Visit http://localhost:5173/debug/settings to see the test page
2. Visit http://localhost:5173/dashboard-example
3. Enable AI Design Mode
4. Click on a LabelValuePair sub-component
5. You should now see all controls including text fields

## What You Can Edit
- **Label**: The label text
- **Value**: The value text
- **Variant**: Default/Stacked/Inline layout
- **Size**: Small/Medium/Large
- **Value Color**: Text color for the value
- **Help Text**: Additional helper text
- **Show Trend**: Toggle trend indicator
- **Trend Direction**: Up/Down/Flat
- **Trend Value**: e.g., +5%, -10%

Note: Sub-component prop updates are not yet implemented, so changes won't apply to the actual component yet.

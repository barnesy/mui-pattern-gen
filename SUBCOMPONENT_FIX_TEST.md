# Sub-Component Selection Fix Test

The issue was that CSS styles for sub-components were missing. This has been fixed.

## What was fixed:
1. Added CSS styles for sub-component hover and selection states
2. Set `data-ai-mode="true"` on body element when AI mode is enabled
3. Created a debug page to test sub-component selection

## How to test:

1. Open http://localhost:5173/debug/subcomponents
2. Enable AI Design Mode using the toggle in the app bar
3. You should now see:
   - Dashed outline on hover for sub-components
   - Solid outline when a sub-component is clicked/selected
   - Breadcrumb navigation in the drawer when a sub-component is selected

## Alternative test on Dashboard:
1. Open http://localhost:5173/dashboard-example
2. Enable AI Design Mode
3. Hover over individual stats or label-value pairs within DataDisplayCards
4. You should see dashed outlines on hover
5. Click to select individual sub-components
6. Check the AI Design drawer for breadcrumb navigation

## Visual indicators:
- **Pattern components**: Purple solid outline (2px)
- **Sub-components on hover**: Purple dashed outline (2px)
- **Selected sub-components**: Purple solid outline (2px) with slight shadow
- When a sub-component is selected, the parent pattern outline is hidden

# GitHub Issues for Code Quality Improvements

## Issue #1: Critical - Extremely Low Test Coverage (6.69%)

**Title**: Increase test coverage from 6.69% to 80%

**Labels**: `bug`, `testing`, `high-priority`

**Description**:
Current test coverage is critically low at 6.69%. This poses significant risks for code reliability and maintainability.

**Current State**:
- Overall coverage: 6.69%
- 0% coverage for main app files, services, state management
- Only 6 test files covering basic utilities and components

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Achieve 80% overall test coverage
- [ ] 100% coverage for critical paths (App.tsx, routing, error handling)
- [ ] All services have unit tests
- [ ] State management fully tested

**Tasks**:
1. Write tests for src/main.tsx and src/App.tsx
2. Test all service layers (logger, asyncHandler)
3. Test state management (stores and contexts)
4. Test critical UI components
5. Add integration tests for data flow

## Issue #2: Critical - 952 ESLint Errors

**Title**: Fix 952 ESLint errors blocking code quality

**Labels**: `bug`, `code-quality`, `high-priority`

**Description**:
ESLint analysis reveals 952 errors that need immediate attention, including type safety issues, code style violations, and React best practice violations.

**Error Breakdown**:
- ~400+ type safety issues (any types, missing return types)
- ~300+ code quality issues (missing braces, == vs ===)
- ~200+ React issues (missing deps, unsafe props)
- ~50+ async/promise issues

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Zero ESLint errors
- [ ] All warnings addressed or suppressed with justification
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent new violations

**Tasks**:
1. Fix TypeScript configuration for vite.config.ts and vitest.config.ts
2. Run `npm run lint -- --fix` for auto-fixable issues
3. Replace all `any` types with proper types
4. Add return types to all functions
5. Fix React hook dependencies
6. Remove console statements

## Issue #3: High - Refactor Large Files

**Title**: Refactor files exceeding 500 lines

**Labels**: `refactor`, `maintainability`, `medium-priority`

**Description**:
Several files exceed 500 lines making them difficult to maintain and test.

**Files to Refactor**:
- `DataDisplayCard.tsx` - 678 lines
- `AIDesignModeDrawer.tsx` - 605 lines
- `ThemeEditor.tsx` - 503 lines

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] No component file exceeds 400 lines
- [ ] Logic extracted to custom hooks
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns
- [ ] Maintains 100% backward compatibility

## Issue #4: High - Implement Logging Service Usage

**Title**: Replace 182 console statements with logger service

**Labels**: `enhancement`, `code-quality`, `medium-priority`

**Description**:
A logger service was created but console statements remain throughout the codebase.

**Current State**:
- Logger service created but has 0% test coverage
- 182 console statements still in use
- No consistent logging patterns

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Zero console statements (except console.warn/error in specific cases)
- [ ] Logger service has 100% test coverage
- [ ] Consistent logging patterns documented
- [ ] Environment-based log levels working

---

## Issue #5: Medium - Add Error Boundaries

**Title**: Implement comprehensive error handling with boundaries

**Labels**: `enhancement`, `error-handling`, `medium-priority`

**Description**:
Error boundaries exist but aren't consistently used throughout the application.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Error boundaries wrap all major route components
- [ ] Custom error messages for different error types
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms in place
- [ ] Error logging to external service (if applicable)
- [ ] 100% test coverage for error scenarios

## Issue #6: Medium - Performance Optimizations

**Title**: Implement React performance optimizations

**Labels**: `performance`, `enhancement`, `medium-priority`

**Description**:
Add React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

**Areas to Optimize**:
- Large list components
- Complex form components
- Frequently updated components
- Context providers

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All expensive components wrapped in React.memo
- [ ] Complex calculations memoized
- [ ] Callback functions properly memoized
- [ ] Performance metrics improved by 20%+

## Issue #7: Medium - Improve TypeScript Types

**Title**: Enhance type safety across the codebase

**Labels**: `typescript`, `code-quality`, `medium-priority`

**Description**:
Improve TypeScript usage by eliminating any types and adding stricter type checking.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
- [ ] Replace all any types with proper types
- [ ] Add return types to all functions
- [ ] Use discriminated unions for complex types
- [ ] Add type guards where necessary

# Drag & Drop Improvements

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Container Sizing
- Containers now properly fit their contents with `minHeight: 'auto'` when they have children
- Empty containers maintain a minimum height for easier dropping (100-120px)
- Removed unnecessary padding when containers have children

### 2. Visual Drop Zone Feedback
- **Empty Containers**: 
  - Entire container area becomes a drop zone
  - Background color changes to indicate valid drop target
  - Border color changes from gray to primary color
  - Text updates to "ðŸ“¦ Drop component here" when hovering

- **Containers with Children**:
  - Dashed outline appears when hovering in the center area
  - Background subtly highlights to show drop zone
  - Edge areas (30px) reserved for before/after positioning

### 3. Drop Target State Management
- Added `isDropTarget` prop to layout components
- Components track their drop target state in real-time
- Visual feedback is immediate and responsive

### 4. Improved Drop Logic
- Empty containers accept drops anywhere within their bounds
- Containers with children use smart edge detection
- Better handling of nested drop zones

### 5. MUI Tooltip Warning Fix
- Wrapped disabled IconButtons in span elements
- Tooltips now properly attach event listeners

## How It Works:

1. **Dragging Over Empty Container**:
   - Entire container highlights
   - Clear visual feedback that it's ready to accept the drop
   - Drop anywhere to add component

2. **Dragging Over Container with Children**:
   - Hover near edges (top/bottom) to insert before/after
   - Hover in center to drop inside container
   - Visual indicators show where component will be placed

3. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Blue dashed border = Drop inside container
   - Blue line above/below = Insert before/after
   - Highlighted background = Valid drop zone
   - Component opacity at 50% while dragging

## Testing:
1. Navigate to `/drag-drop-design`
2. Click "Create Demo" 
3. Try dragging components into the Grid container - it should highlight
4. Drag components from palette directly into containers
5. Reorder components by dragging near edges
